Questions to answer about the database design:

What is it for?
  - Keep track of comments on jokes. 

What do you have?
  - No database yet. 

What tables do you need? "You have to create a table for every entity, the tables are the basic building blocks of the database. Each object or thing that needs to be represented in your system."
  - Joke
  - Comment
  - User

Tables can be categorized in Schemas. E.g. User.comments, joke.comments. This is not needed in small databases. 

What columns do you need?
Store your columns as granular as possible. First_name, Last_name instead of name

Every row in every table needs a primary key that uniquely defines this row. 

What relationships do you need?
Never duplicate entries, remove as much redundancy in you database as possible. 

The database needs to adhere to the 4 normal forms:
1. only one dataentry per cell
2. no partial dependency.
3. no transitive dependency.
4. A non-key attribute cannot determine a partial key.

notes:
the primary key can consist of multiple columns

What is the difference between a database and a spreadsheet?
- with a database we can make very specific queries in large amounts of data.
-give specific users different permissions in the database: security feature
- a database stores attributes from entities. a row is also referred to as a tuple. :
